### Hi there :raised_hand:

My name is Ivan Seibel and I'm a full-stack developer with about 20 years of experience and completely passionate about what I do.

Since 2017, I have been investing a lot of effort in becoming a specialist in the Node.js, ReactJS, and React Native technology stack, which in my opinion is the most productive for developing integrated web and mobile applications.

During this journey I also had the opportunity to learn more about frameworks, tools, libraries and all kind of stuff that support the JavaScript as a powerful language for web.

This is my laboratory and my playground, feel free to snoop, use and share whatever content you find useful for you. ;)
