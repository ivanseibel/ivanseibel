### Hi there :raised_hand:

My name is Ivan Seibel and I'm a full-stack developer with about 20 years of experience and completely passionate about what I do.

Since 2017 I have been dedicating a lot of time and money to specialize in that stack that I consider the most productive to build complete solutions for web and mobile: Node.js, ReactJS and React Native.

During this journey I also had the opportunity to learn more about frameworks, tools, libraries and all kind of stuff that support the JavaScript as a powerful language for web.

This is my laboratory and my playground, feel free to snoop, use and share whatever content you find useful for you. ;)
